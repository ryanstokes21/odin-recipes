I have shown that I can preform a veriety of html elements in this projet using the boilerplate firt then adding links, a href, specifing our, target, to other pages then providing headers h1, h2 ect.. We then used a image of the recipe using img, src, and alt. I provided a breef paragraph, p, and then put my ingrediants in a unordered list using, ul, and li. I provided the directions for the dish in a ordered list using, ol, and li. I also used, br, to give the page a little more structure.
